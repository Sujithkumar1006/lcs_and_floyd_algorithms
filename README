This project contains two C Source code

1. Longest common subsequence using Dynamic Programming
2. Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices

Both the source code files can be compiled using the Makefile using the command make all.

To run LCS : 
    1. Run the executable by ./lcs <input-string-1> <input-string-2> 
    2. It will print out the output on command line.

To run Floyd-Warshall algorithm:
    1. Run the executable by providing a input file by ./floyd <graph-file-name>
    2. It will produce output.txt file with the PMatrix and shortest distance from each vertices
