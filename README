This project contains two C Source code

1. Longest common subsequence using Dynamic Programming
2. Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices

To run LCS : 
    1. Compile the source code using gcc -o lcs.out lcs.c 
    2. Run the executable by ./lcs.out <input-string-1> <input-string-2> 
    3. It will print out the output on command line.

To run Floyd-Warshall algorithm:
    1. Compile the source code using gcc floyd.c
    2. Run the executable by providing a input .txt file by ./a.out <graph-file-name>
    3. It will produce output.txt file with the PMatrix and shortest distance from each vertices
